# ThreeJSTests
Tests of three.js project implementation

Learning of three.js library and what could be achieved with it.

1. Project setup.
Workspace environment configured in VS Code.
Webpack configured for single-page-application (test with command "npm run build")
Project libraries (three.js, cannon.js and others added)
Documentation generation added. To generate, use "documentation build src/** -f html -o docs"

NEXT STEPS: 
in next branch I will add REACT to have navigation to different views for single-page-application setup
once working, I will try to implement internationalization with Intl

Optionally, I will add webpack configuration for babel (old versions compatibility) and minify for production version
