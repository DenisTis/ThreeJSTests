# ThreeJSTests
Tests of three.js project implementation

Learning of three.js library and what could be achieved with it.

1.1 Final project setup:
Additionally to what we done before, we need to do following:
[X] Automation to build development version and production version with documentation

Decide how to implement navigation to different views inside of single-page-application?
[X] Decided to user React with Router
[X] Setup React: needed to install all babel plugins, as w/o them there is an error (see "babel-loader-jsx-syntaxerror-unexpected-token")
[X] Setup and test Routing
[ ] Important: for react, view (similar to html+css), should be separated from viewmodel, because React itself can have it in one file
[ ] Implement internationalization

[ ] Build start page of the application with multi-language support
[X] Enable bootstrap for the page

========Next branch================
[ ] THREEJS + CANNON initialization and finalization
[ ] Correct adding and removal of scene objects
[ ] Memory management tests
